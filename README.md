# An_Interactive_Polygon_Drawing_Tool
This Python code uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a series of polygons, starting with a square and then moving on to a triangle, pentagon,
hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, and decagon. The color of each polygon changes after it is drawn.

#Simple Shapes with Turtle
This program draws a square, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, and decagon using the Turtle graphics library.

#How it works
The program works by using the Turtle graphics library to draw a series of lines. The lines are drawn in a specific order to create the desired shapes.
The colors of the shapes are also defined in the program.

The program uses the following functions to draw the shapes:

line(): This function draws a line of a specified length.
tri(): This function draws a triangle.
square(): This function draws a square.
pentagon(): This function draws a pentagon.
hexagon(): This function draws a hexagon.
heptagon(): This function draws a heptagon.
octagon(): This function draws an octagon.
nanogon(): This function draws a nonagon.
decagon(): This function draws a decagon.
The program also uses the following variables to define the properties of the shapes:

tim: This variable is a reference to the Turtle object.
pensize: This variable defines the thickness of the lines.
color: This variable defines the color of the lines.
The program uses the following loops to draw the shapes:

for _ in range(3):: This loop draws three lines to create a triangle.
for _ in range(4):: This loop draws four lines to create a square.
for _ in range(5):: This loop draws five lines to create a pentagon.
for _ in range(6):: This loop draws six lines to create a hexagon.
for _ in range(7):: This loop draws seven lines to create a heptagon.
for _ in range(8):: This loop draws eight lines to create an octagon.
for _ in range(9):: This loop draws nine lines to create a nonagon.
for _ in range(10):: This loop draws ten lines to create a decagon.
The program also uses the following functions to move the Turtle object:

tim.right(120):: This function rotates the Turtle object 120 degrees to the right.
tim.backward(100):: This function moves the Turtle object backward 100 pixels.
